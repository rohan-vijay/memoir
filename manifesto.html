					We increasingly live our lives online but social media is becoming increasingly less real, a fair reflection of who we truly are.<br><br>

					Venture is changing this. We are re a community of individuals who are not afraid of showing our true selves, who care deeply, and believe life is too short to not be ourselves, outwardly and inwardly.<br><br>

					Truth is: our lives are not a continuos sequence of social media worthy highlights. It are the little things, sometimes the painful things (most definitely also the happy things) - that move us, touch us, make us who we are.<br><br>

					Memoir is the place to share them.<br><br>

					Currently, the platform is only open to trailblazing individuals. Individuals who one way or another are on the path less traveled, believe in challenging the status quo (for the better), and otherwise stand out as extraordinary - be it in bravery, creativity, honesty, or more.<br><br>

					It is a home for creators and change-makers: Early (to late) stage founders, designers, writers, people working at startups, freelancers, and more. Anyone who does not fit in a mold.<br><br>

					Truth of the matter is, there are benefits to living some of our lives online, it is where this world is heading. <br><br>

					Memoir is the most honest online reflection of who you are.<br><br>

					We are committed to efficiency and effectiveness because we believe an honest platform has real life offline benefits, that iss why we want to make the online experience as seamless as possible, and get you back to living your life.<br><Br>
